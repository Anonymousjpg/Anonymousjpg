# Medieval-weaponry-shop
It's still early work in porogress, with almost non existant frontend, but I've decided to put it here as it is, to practise updating project with github. In general its a store with working signup and login. It has working products and partially a shopping cart (for the time being its not signed to any particular user).

Added sessions. Now when you enter cart, a new cart is created ither you do it logged in or not. It closes after 30 minutes (time to be adjusted).Session'll close if a user will log out. 
This way a user adds some stuff to the cart that is created for him. Other user that opens a cart, opens it under new id so he has his own cart.
Next thing to make will be payments.
