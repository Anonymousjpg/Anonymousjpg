# Medieval-weaponry-shop
It's an e-commerce page of medieval shop. I've updated it lately. Login, signup and reset pasword worked earlier. I've worked a little bit on frontend, so it wouldn't look so scetchy. Now it has working items list with sorting by category and product detail. It has simple yet working cart. Right now I'm working on checkout and payment. After that I'll try to deploy it someware for free. If I'd have some spare time I could add sorting products by name, price etc. or subcategories like short swords, long swords and so on for swords category and similar for other categories. Cart also needs a little work too.
